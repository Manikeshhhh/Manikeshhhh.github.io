### privilege escalation from User to Owner due to Mass assignment issue   
This is a issue i found few months back on one of H1 Private program which was sadly duplicate

User who has permission to invite other users to Org can invite any user as Owner and takeover the Organization.
I was also able to bypass the limit set to free that a Org can have only 2 Users
